## ðŸ§  Machine Learning & AI Concepts Used

This project integrates **AI & ML techniques** for efficient timetable management:

### **1. Natural Language Processing (NLP)**
- Understands text-based timetable inputs.
- Uses tokenization, lemmatization, and semantic similarity.

### **2. Sentiment Analysis (Optional)**
- Analyses priority tags like "important", "urgent", "flexible".

### **3. Classification Model**
- Classifies events based on **priority levels** using supervised ML models like Logistic Regression .

### **4. Predictive Analysis**
- Predicts **optimal scheduling patterns** using historical data.

### **5. Model Evaluation Metrics**
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score to measure performance.
